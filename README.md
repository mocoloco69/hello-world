# hello-world
This is my first attempt at a GitHub repository.
I'm in the process of learning about programming. I've started an online course
that is teaching my to use the new "Go" programming language developed by Google.
I have never done any kind of programming, so this is all VERY new to me.
As part of the course, the instructor is having me setup a GitHub account, and GitHub
is having me set up this hello-world repsoitory and modify this readme file as an 
introduction to learning GitHub. So I'm learning 2 differnent programs at the same time!
It's kind of exhausting...
